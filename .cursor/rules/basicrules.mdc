When we have a problem we need to solve, review all pieces of information regarding the problem, all files that have anything to do with the issue. 
Make sure you only fix the issue at hand and don't do anything more unless you ask for permission first.
Make your fixes precise.
Never change anything that is currently working correctly, unless it's absolutely neccessary, and ask for permission first.
All db changes need to be done manually, you need to provide a prompt for the sql editor for me to run.
All api calls need to be done as an xmlhttprequest with event listeners otherwise we don't get proper usable responses.
